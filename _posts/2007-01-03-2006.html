<p>There's no denying that this has been an italo disco year. I discovered the Cybernetic Broadcasting System (CBS) and its annual Top 100 at the tail end of 2005 as it was broadcasted, and it triggered a period of italo and general 80s rediscovery that has lasted pretty much all year. So therefore, an unproportionally large portion of the Top 50 below is CBS- and italo-related.</p>

<p>I'd like to apologise in advance for my inability to express the genius of the music, I find it incredibly hard to come up with language that describes the feeling you get when listening to a tune, but I still felt comments are needed because lists without commentary are dead dull to read.</p>

<p>Also, I should point out that the list below contains my favourites out of the music I discovered in 2006 rather than music that was released in 2006.</p>
