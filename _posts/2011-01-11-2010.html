<p>It's that time of year again. Top 100 time. As always, these are not necessarily tracks that came out this year, but rather tracks that somehow caught my attention this year. This year, I seem to have been overwhelmingly stuck in 2009.</p>

<p>Before starting to compile this, I had the feeling that I hadn't discovered all that much music this year, so I was pleasantly surprised to be able to scrape together more than enough tracks for a top 100. Closer to the truth is probably that I haven't sought out and researched as much, instead I have mainly other people to thank for bringing many of these songs to my attention. So thank you Rajesh, Iris, Nisa, Arto, Nathan, Sasha, Martin, Helena etc.</p>

<p>I can't be bothered to write a little mini review of each track this time. Here's the top discoveries of 2010.</p>
