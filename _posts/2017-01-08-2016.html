<p>Music discovery unfortunately took a back seat during the last couple of years due to all spare time going to flat renovations. Hence, there was never a <em>Best of 2015</em>. To make up for it, here's a double whammy of a top 100 containing the tracks that did it for me during both 2015 and 2016.</p>

<p>Rave revival seems to have been the theme this time around. Not only are Special Request and Zomby occupying a healthy number of spots, catchy house scorchers and deep techno workouts that wear their 90s influences on their sleeves, were very much the order of the day.</p>

<p>Confirming my late adopter tendencies, 2015 was the year I got into bassline. I was far too deeply submerged in a sweet italo haze back in 07/08 to quite understand what all the fuss was about. Both DJ Q and Royal-T made it into the top 10 with ridiculously infectious stompers.</p>

<p>PC Music are still delivering the goods, Danny L. Harle, Hannah Diamond, easyFun and Sophie all crafted highly perfected post-truth pop, Martial Canterel kept doing his thing as solidly as ever, and Norwegian Susanne Sundf√∏r, of whom I had never before heard, delivered a devastatingly masterful Valerie Dore pastiche in <em>Slowly</em>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Panacea there's even some hardstyle in this year's list, along with some murderously uplifting drum & bass.</p>

<p>But the top spot, surprisingly, goes to Dead Can Dance, whose glorious 1987 album <em>Within the Realm of a Dying Sun</em> had managed to pass me by until now. The string arrangement in <em>Perspehone</em> is simply unrivalled.</p>

<p>(Oh, and there's some metal.)</p>
