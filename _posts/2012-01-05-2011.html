<p>My top 100 discoveries of 2011. It's been another year dominated by men with analogue synthesizers trying to sound like it's 1984, but with a good measure of other things thrown in too. There's some slow-motion disco, glo-fi, Detroit techno, reverb-drenched wall-of-guitar indie, hard-as-nails skullstep, italo, chart pop, drone metal and a dashing of neglected Hospital-style d&b, topping it off with a suitably triumphant number one. Business as usual in other words.</p>
